# React + Vite

API:

- https://substantive.pythonanywhere.com/

Your task is to pull in this data through the API and create an application that outputs this data in a web application (HTML) which will show the percentages of interactions this client has for each sector.

Bonus points for:

- A nice UI that makes the most of the output
- Use of a css preprocessor
- Use of graphs/tables
- Sharing your plan and approach (any notes you made before coding started)
- Any future plans for how the application could be improved

How to run it:

01 Once the file-repository has been downloaded from GitHub to your local computer, install the node_modules folder in the same project directory, using the 'npm install' command in the terminal.

02 Run the project and view it on localhost by running 'npm run dev' in the terminal.
